            <p>2.1 Your compliance: You agree to comply with any and all the guidelines, notices, operating rules and policies and instructions pertaining to the purchase of Products through the Platform, as well as any amendments to the aforementioned, issued by PFT (whether as part of use of the Platform or in relation to the purchase of Products, on behalf of Seller), from time to time. PFT reserves the right to revise these guidelines, notices, operating rules and policies and instructions at any time and you are deemed to be aware of and bound by any changes to the foregoing upon their publication on the Platform.</p>
            <p>2.2 Product description: While Seller endeavours to provide an accurate description of the Products, neither PFT nor Seller warrants that such description is accurate, current or free from error. In the event that the Product you receive is of a fundamentally different nature from the Product as described on the Platform and which you have ordered, Clause 6 of these Terms & Conditions of Sale shall apply.</p>
            <p>2.3 Sellers: Products are sold by “Sellers”. PFT may be a “Seller” for selected Products. “Seller” may also refer to a party other than PFT (such party referred to in these Terms & Conditions of Sale as a “Third Party Vendor”). Whether a particular Product is listed for sale on the Platform by PFT or a Third Party Vendor may be stated on the webpage listing that Product. Products sold to you by Sellers will be governed by individual Customer Contracts (more details below in Clause 2.6) which:</p>
            <p>2.3.1 for Products sold by Third Party Vendors, shall be agreements entered into directly and only between the Third Party Vendor and you; and</p>
            <p>2.3.2 for Products sold by PFT, shall be agreements entered into directly and only between PFT and you.</p>
            <p>2.4 Placing your Order: You may place an Order by completing the Order form on the Platform and clicking on the “Place my Order” button. Seller will not accept Orders placed in any other manner. You shall be responsible for ensuring the accuracy of the Order.</p>
            <p>2.5 Orders are irrevocable and unconditional: All Orders will be deemed to be irrevocable and unconditional upon transmission through the Platform and Seller shall be entitled (but not obliged) to process such Order(s) without your further consent and without any further reference or notice to you. Nevertheless, in certain circumstances as stated in Clause 8, you may request to cancel or amend the Order which Seller will endeavour to give effect to on a commercially reasonable effort basis. However, notwithstanding the foregoing, Seller is not obliged to give effect to any request to cancel or amend any Order.</p>
            <p>2.6 Seller’s reservation of rights in respect of Orders: All Orders shall be subject to Seller’s acceptance in its sole discretion and each Order accepted by Seller (such accepted Order to be referred to as a “Customer Contract”) shall constitute a separate contract. You acknowledge that unless you receive a notice from Seller accepting your Order, Seller shall not be party to any legally binding agreements or promises made between Seller and you for the sale or other dealings with the Product(s) and accordingly Seller shall not be liable for any Losses which may be incurred as a result. For the avoidance of doubt, Seller reserves the right to decline to process or accept any Order received from or through the Platform in its absolute discretion.</p>
            <p>2.7 Termination by Seller in the event of pricing error: Seller reserves the right to terminate the Customer Contract, in the event that a Product has been mispriced on the Platform, in which event PFT shall, on behalf of Seller, notify you of such cancellation by giving three days’ notice.

You also acknowledge and agree that the exclusion of warranties, exclusion of liability and exclusion of remedies in these Terms & Conditions of Sale and Customer Contracts allocate risks between the parties and permit Seller to provide the Products at lower fees or prices than Seller otherwise could and you agree that such exclusions on liability are reasonable.</p>

            <p>2.10.5 Seller is not liable for any Losses suffered by any third party directly or indirectly caused by repairs or remedial work carried out without PFT’s prior written approval and the Customer shall indemnify Seller against all Losses arising out of such claims;</p>
            <p>2.10.6 Seller shall be under no liability under the above warranty (or any other warranty, condition or guarantee) if the total price for the Products has not been paid in cleared funds by the due date for payment; and</p>
